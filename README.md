# brain-tumor-classification
This is my machine learning course project .
The project uses MRI images and classified tumor type data to classify the images to a type of tumor .
The project uses pretrained models and a custom convolutional neural network ,with a lot of experimental parameters and choice of optimizer 
preprocessing techniques .
